A facial recognition security system with SMS notification functionality is a modern access control solution. It uses advanced facial recognition technology to identify authorized users. When an authorized person is detected, the system sends an SMS notification to a designated recipient, providing real-time updates on who has entered a secure area. This technology enhances security and access control, making it suitable for both residential and commercial applications. It ensures that only authorized individuals gain entry while providing instant alerts for added security.
